# 2024-2025 Premier League Seaon Prediction 

## Overview 
This project will incorperate a machine learning model that predicts the outcomes for the 2024-2025 Premier League season based on historical match data found on kaggle. The dataset will be used to train models to predict match outcomes, as well as evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. The goal is to create a predictive model that accurately estimates team standings and other outcomes throughout the season. 

## Project Objectives 
- Understanding different trends in Premier League data to identify key factors that have influence on match outcomes.
- Utilizing feature engineering to improve model prediction accuracy.
- Using classification to train and test the model in order to predict match outcomes, optimizing for accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Evaluate the model to assess performance and make imporvemets as needed. 
- Using the final model to predict the outcomes of matches in the 2024-2025 season.
- Provide visualizations into model predictions and performance.
